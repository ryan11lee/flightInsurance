# flightInsurance
API and calculator tool for calculating payouts of flight delays

# Summary

Build a tool that utilizes and API to determine how delayed a flight is. And keep a sqlite database of the previous transactions.
This project was a small scale project to play around with APIs and determine when a user randomly selected a set of flights on popular routes would there be a viable business idea to have passengers purchase insurance against flight delays.
Given the prevalence of delays and the added cost that would be required for the business to be profitable in this current state it seems that it is not viable. Further work on th business logic would be required to determine other ways of moneitizing peoples time during traveling.
